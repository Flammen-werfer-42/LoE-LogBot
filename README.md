# LoE-LogBot
This is a bot that can log messages on the Legends of Equestria Discord

This bot is written in Javascript off the Node framework.
Remember when setting up the bot on Discord to use the generated token ID and apply it to "const token" in the index.js file. 

To start the bot, type <node .> into the terminal.

Legends of Equestria Moderators have full reign to use the source code to either replicate or improve the bot at any time whether I am still a moderator or not.

All code provided should work, except a new token should be generated to get a new version of the bot running. 

The bot will log all normal messages in the format:
-channel name ( ) --time ( )
----Author ( ) --message content ( ) -- picture link [if one is attached] -- user mentioned [if someone is @'d] -- channel mentioned [if someone uses #channel]

At the time of this being written, the current blockers that will kill the bot are embedded messages from other bots, and IP address changes (if using VPN).
