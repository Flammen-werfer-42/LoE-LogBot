# LoE-LogBot
This is a bot that can log messages on the Legends of Equestria Discord

This bot is written in Javascript off the Node framework.

Legends of Equestria Moderators have full reign to use the source code to either replicate or improve the bot whether I am still a moderator or not.

All code provided should work, except a new token should be generated to get a new version of the bot running. 

The bot will log all normal messages in the format:
-channel name ( ) --time ( )
----Author ( ) --message content ( ) (-- picture link [if one is attached] -- user mentioned [if someone is @'d] -- channel mentioned [if someone uses #]

At the time if this being written, the current blockers that will kill the bot are embedded messages, IP address changes (if using VPN), and certain kinds of links if they're typed in an incorrect format.
